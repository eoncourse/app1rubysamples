Yukihiro "matz" Matsumoto blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) 
He formed a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.
He has often said that he is "trying to make Ruby natural, not simple," in a way that mirrors life.
Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body.
